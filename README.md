# HR Dashboard – User Story & Requirements

## User Story
As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary insights and detailed employee records for informed decision-making.

# Project Description
This project aims to build a complete HR Analytics Dashboard that helps organizations understand their workforce more effectively. The dashboard provides both high-level insights and detailed employee information, allowing HR managers to monitor hiring trends, workforce composition, salary structures, and performance correlations.  
The project includes:
- Designing a mockup for the dashboard layout
- Generating a synthetic dataset suitable for HR analytics
- Building the dashboard using Tableau Public
- Structuring the documentation and workflow using Notion
- Using icons and visuals to enhance dashboard clarity

The goal is to create a clean, professional, and interactive dashboard that can support real HR decision-making in areas like recruitment, performance evaluation, salary fairness, and workforce planning.

# Dashboard Structure
The dashboard consists of two main pages:
1. Summary View
2. Employee Records View

# 1. Summary View
The Summary View is divided into three main sections:
- Overview
- Demographics
- Income Analysis

## Overview
The Overview section provides a snapshot of key HR metrics:
- Total number of hired, active, and terminated employees
- Hiring vs termination trends over the years
- Employee distribution by department
- Employee distribution by job titles
- Comparison between HQ (New York) and branches
- Employee distribution by city and state

## Demographics
This section provides insights into workforce composition:
- Gender ratio
- Distribution of employees across age groups
- Total number of employees within each age group
- Distribution of employees by education level
- Total number of employees within each education category
- Correlation between education level and performance rating

## Income Analysis
This section focuses on salary-related metrics:
- Salary comparison across education levels for both genders
- Relationship between age and salary for employees in each department

# 2. Employee Records View
A detailed view listing all employees with:
- Name
- Department
- Position
- Gender
- Age
- Education
- Salary

### Filtering
Users can filter the employee list based on any available column.

# Tools Used

- **Tableau Public**: To design and publish the HR dashboard.
- **Draw.io**: To create mockups and layout designs before building the dashboard.
- **ChatGPT**: To generate a synthetic dataset for development and testing.
